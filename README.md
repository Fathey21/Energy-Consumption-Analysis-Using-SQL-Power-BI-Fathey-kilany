# Energy-Consumption-Analysis-Using-SQL-Power-BI-Fathey-kilany
________________________________________
##Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement a complete Business Intelligence solution using SQL Server, ETL techniques, and Power BI to analyze household electricity consumption and support decision making.
________________________________________
##General Project Requirements
•	Use at least two heterogeneous data sources (CSV & SQL Server).
•	Apply ETL process for data cleansing and transformation.
•	Design a Data Warehouse using dimensional modeling.
•	Build an interactive Power BI dashboard.
________________________________________
##Data Sources Requirements
•	CSV File: Household power consumption dataset.
•	SQL Server Database: Dimension tables (Households, Regions, TariffPlans).
________________________________________
##Data Warehouse Design (SQL Server)
A Star Schema design was implemented:
•	Fact Table: EnergyConsumption
•	Dimension Tables: Households, Regions, TariffPlans, DateDim
This design improves query performance and analytical reporting.
