# Energy Consumption Analysis Dashboard## Business Problem:A national energy authority wants to analyze household electricity consumption data to understand usage patterns over time, compare consumption across households,and support better energy planning decisions.## Data Sources- A CSV file (energy_consumption.csv) was created as a reference from the experimental data- All data was transformed and analyzed inside Power BI- Fact Table: energy_consumption (HouseholdID, Date, Energy_KWh, AverageConsumption, EstimatedCost, Total Energy)- Dimension Table: Date Table (Date, DayOfWeek, Month, MonthNo, Year)- No actual SQLite database was used for production## ETL ProcessThe following transformations were applied using Power Query in Power BI:1. Changed data types2. Renamed columns3. Reordered columns4. Created a Date table## Data Model- Fact Table: energy_consumption- Dimension Table: Date Table- Star schema model implemented in Power BI## Dashboard Features- Total Energy Consumption KPI- Average Consumption- Consumption Trend over Time- Consumption by Household## Tools Used- Power BI Desktop- Power Query- GitHub## Note about DatabaseAll data was generated and transformed inside Power BI.The following SQL schema is provided as reference:-- Dimension Table: Date TableCREATE TABLE [Date Table] (    Date DATE PRIMARY KEY,    DayOfWeek VARCHAR(10),    Month VARCHAR(20),    MonthNo INT,    Year INT);-- Dimension Table: HouseholdsCREATE TABLE Households (    HouseholdID VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,    Region VARCHAR(50));-- Fact Table: energy_consumptionCREATE TABLE energy_consumption (    HouseholdID VARCHAR(10),    Date DATE,    Energy_KWh DECIMAL(10,2),    AverageConsumption DECIMAL(10,2),    EstimatedCost DECIMAL(10,2),    TotalEnergy DECIMAL(10,2),    FOREIGN KEY (HouseholdID) REFERENCES Households(HouseholdID));
